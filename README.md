- 👋 Hi, I’m LYM (刘祎铭).
- 🔭 I’m interested in RLHF, Adversarial Defense, Diffusion, and VLM.
- 🌱 I’m currently a master student at [SYSU HCP Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/) supervised by Prof. [Liang Lin](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/faculty/lianglin.html).
- 💞️ My ICLR2025 paper ["Towards Understanding the Robustness of Diffusion-Based Purification: A Stochastic Perspective"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=shqjOIK3SA) has been accepted, collaborated with @Buntender!
- 💞️ I've been an active contributor to [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/refactor-detr), collaborated with [Shilong Zhang](https://jshilong.github.io/), and given a talk at the [Community open mic](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17x4y1w7ZK/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click).
