- 👋 Hi, I’m LYM(刘祎铭)
- 🔭 I’m interested in Adversarial Defense, Diffusion, Object Detection(DETR series) and Multimodal Model.
- 🌱 I’m currently a master student at [SYSU HCP Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/) supervised by Prof. [Liang Lin](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/faculty/lianglin.html).
- 💞️ I've been an active contributor of [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/refactor-detr), collaborated with [Shilong Zhang](https://jshilong.github.io/), and have given a talk at [Community open mic](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17x4y1w7ZK/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click).
- 🤔 I am seeking assistance in finding an internship opportunity.
